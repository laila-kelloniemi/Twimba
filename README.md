<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h1 align="center">Twimba</h1>
<h3 align="center">- the Twitter clone created by Scrimba, and further developed by me</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Twimba is a Twitter clone page, mimicking the design and several functionalities of Twitter. The Twimba project was originally created for a Javascript Essentials course by Scrimba - an online Front End Developer educational resource. 

After completing this project within the Scrimba course, I have added several functionalities to the original Twimba page. This required changes in all files of the project. In addition, I made the CSS responsive. Details clarifying the differences between the original design and my own version of the Twimba can be found in the <a href="#contribution"> Contribution </a>section below.

Twimba was built using vanilla Javascript. Many of its features present common development problems, which could have been solved using frameworks and libraries. However, the intent for building Twimba was to learn how to think through pure Javascript and find solutions to problems using only the coding language in question.

## About Twimba

Twimba was built as a Front End project; it showcases all the basic Front End requirements for a social media web app, such as commenting, posting, liking, and saving data in the localStorage for browser refresh. It is not intended to be a fully functional app, since it does not have any Back End functionalities. It was, however, a delightful opportunity to learn how to build the Front End of a social media app.

Opening the Twimba web page, a user can add previously added tweets, add their own tweet, react to a tweet, and reply to it. These will be stored through browser refresh until the user either deletes or hides a tweet or a reply or resets the whole app by clicking on the "start over" button.

## Contribution

My contribution to developing Twimba was to do with responsive CSS, UX additions, some stylistic variations, and certain Javascript features. These include: storing the user-imposed changes in localStorage, the ability to remove and hide individual tweets and replies, the ability to post replies, and the start-over feature to reset Twimba. 

During the Scrimba course, the following features were finished: rendering the tweet feed, creating a new tweet, and responsive replies, likes and retweet icons. Since then I have made several modifications to all these features as well. 

The original Twimba app can be viewed in the Scrimba Front End Developer Career Path course, Essential Javascript Concepts module:
