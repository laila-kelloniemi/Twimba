<h1 align="center">Twimba</h1>
<h3 align="center">- the Twitter Clone Created by Scrimba, and Further Developed by Me</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Twimba is a Twitter clone that mimics the design and various functionalities of Twitter. The Twimba project was originally created for a Javascript Essentials course offered by Scrimba, an online educational resource for front-end development.

Upon completing the project in the Scrimba course, I expanded the functionality of the original Twimba page, making modifications across all project files. Additionally, I made the CSS responsive. For details clarifying the differences between the original design and my own version of the Twimba, please refer to the <a href="#contributions"> Contributions </a>section below.

Twimba was built using vanilla Javascript. Many of its features present common development problems, which could be solved using frameworks and libraries. However, the purpose of building Twimba was to develop problem-solving skills and gain a deeper understanding of pure JavaScript by relying solely on the coding language itself.

## About Twimba

Twimba was built as a front-end project; it showcases all the basic a front-end requirements for a social media web app, such as commenting, posting, liking, and saving data in the localStorage for browser refresh. It is not intended to be a fully functional app, since it does not have any back-end functionalities. It was, however, a delightful opportunity to learn how to build the a front-end of a social media app.

When accessing the Twimba web app, users can perform various actions such as replying to existing tweets, posting their own tweets, reacting to tweets, and engaging in threaded replies. These interactions persist after browser refresh, unless the user chooses to delete or hide a tweet or reset the entire app by clicking the 'start over' button.

## Contributions

In my contribution to developing Twimba, I focused on implementing new JavaScript features, UX enhancements, and responsive CSS.

These features include storing user changes using localStorage, enabling the removal and hiding of individual tweets and replies, supporting reply functionality, and implementing the start-over feature to reset Twimba.

During the Scrimba course, I completed the implementation of rendering the tweet feed, creating new tweets, and ensuring responsiveness for reply, like, and retweet icons. Since then, I have made several modifications to enhance these features further.

The original Twimba app can be viewed in the Scrimba Front End Developer Career Path course, Essential Javascript Concepts module:
